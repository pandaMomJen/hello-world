Hello, 

I am a Panda. Just kidding. But not really.

I'm here on a mission to explore the world of coding. Let's have some fun together. I'm a total noob but I will be a pro someday. Just you wait and watch.

I have schooled in PHP and a tiny bit in Java. I learned too much about databases but yet not enough to become a database person. Same goes for websites. I have a passion in creating and building websites but I feel completely lost in this digital world of many different languages and endless possibilities.

If I can go on, I'll be asking what is life soon so let's end it here.
